# Modelling Blood Flow in the Dementia Brain

This repo is for my fourth year master's project of my Engineering Science Degree at Oxford Uni. I received **80% (high 1st)** for this work. The final report and presentation can be found in the files.

The project is a novel attempt to quantify the effect that cerebral blood flow may have on the processes thought to cause Alzheimer's Dementia. The disciplines covered include computing, civil and boimedical engineering. The quantiative analysis revolves around a Runge-Kutta 4th order numerical solver, created bespokely for the complex and varied nature of the differential equations.
